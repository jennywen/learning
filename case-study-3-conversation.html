        As artificial intelligence becomes ever more accessible, chatbots are finding new use cases, and designers are predicting that they’ll become an integral part of our lives in the next few years. This module will explore different types of conversational interfaces and some principles for designing one.

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Chatbots</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Conversational interfaces are often called chatbots, invisible apps, or virtual assistants,  and they’ve been used in applications for a few decades now. Within the past few years, however, they’ve taken off due to advancements in technology and have been used across mass-messaging applications like Facebook Messenger, Slack, and WhatsApp.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">For designers, chatbots can be uncharted territory since designing a chatbot doesn’t involve as much of the traditional pixel-pushing and interface refinement as design has involved in the past. Instead, it involves steps like designing the personality of the chatbot and the mechanics of the conversation with it. I’m learning about chatbots for the first time, too, so I’ll be sure to break down some of the differences and the gaps in learning.</p>

        To understand the proliferation of chatbots, I wanted to learn about the history of chatbots and how the lessons learned from each iteration helped bring about this new wave of them.

        ELIZA was a program created in 1966 that imitated the responses of a psychotherapist based on user inputs. Although ELIZA was intentioned to be a parody of actual psychotherapists, users did start confessing their deepest thoughts to ELIZA, rendering her functionally similar to an actual psychotherapist.

      <p class="lh-copy">
        SmarterChild came to fruition in the early 2000s, and was the first chatbot to penetrate the mass consumer market. SmarterChild was released on major messaging platforms and acted as a fun chat companion as well as an information provider. At the time, however, machine intelligence was not as advanced and required a substantial amount of scripted content in order to maintain SmarterChild’s conversations.
      </p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Chatbot comeback</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">In this latest generation of chatbots, utility is of utmost priority. On the backs of ELIZA and SmarterChild, people who develop chatbots now recognize that the novelty of talking to a bot wears off quickly, and that people are more likely to use bots not if they have a unique personality, but if they can help complete tasks that are difficult otherwise.</p>
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">principles</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">
        I pulled some of the guidelines that really stuck out to me from Intercom’s <a class="link underline dim silver" href="https://medium.com/intercom-inside/8-principles-of-bot-design-51f03df1d84c">8 Principles of Bot Design</a> and <a class="link underline dim silver" href="https://alistapart.com/article/all-talk-and-no-buttons-the-conversational-ui">A List Apart’s All Talk and No Buttons</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">First impressions are important</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">The first interaction with a bot should be an introduction that’s short and to the point, but gives people a clear picture of what they can use the bot to do.</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">It’s still a bot</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">As much as we want to manufacture the impression that users are talking to a real person, bots are still bots and we shouldn’t overstep those bounds. This means keeping a tone that’s evidently not human, and not manufacturing interactions like pauses for typing.</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">There’s a time and place for a bot</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">As great it would be to have a bot to solve each and every one of our problems, Intercom’s Paul Adams in <a class="link underline dim silver" href="https://blog.intercom.com/bots-versus-humans/">Bots versus Humans</a> explains the difference between tasks humans are good and tasks better handled by bots. Simply put, bots are great for menial tasks and computation at efficiencies much higher than that of a human, but humans are better at emotional connection and reading the lines. Maybe there’ll be a time in the future when technology will have advanced and that’s no longer true, but for now Adams still believes in the value of having the option to speak to a human.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Make it discoverable</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">With chatbots, there’s no interface to present all of the user’s options to them. Chatbots should have carrots to help lead users to get to reach their goals and direct them in the way of unknown functionalities that’ll help the do that. </p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Simple, not strenuous</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">While chatbots deliver content conversationally, it’s easy to get carried away and stray from a user’s goals. Conversation should still be kept minimal and shouldn’t require users to enter multiple prompts to get to what they need. It shouldn’t be harder for the user to use the chatbot, than to get what they want done without it.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Examples</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">
        Based on the principles I just outlined, I analyzed a few chatbots to understand the intentions behind their designs.
      </p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Slackbot</div>

  </section>

  <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
    <p class="lh-copy">
      Slackbot is the first interaction users have once they’ve signed up to join a <a class="link underline dim silver" href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> team. By introducing itself from the get go, Slackbot not only shows me how Slack works, but also makes me aware of its existence in any case I need help.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy">
      Slackbot also uses boldface words to make conversations easy to scan and find keywords for the sake of discoverability. I also like that conversations are broken up with links and emojis and line breaks to make them not too strenuous to read.

    <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Uber</div>

  </section>

  <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
    <p class="lh-copy">Uber’s chatbot for Messenger integrates with the existing workflow of users by recognizing addresses and allowing users to order a ride without exiting the Messenger app. It also sends all updates and actions to Messenger, without any overcomplicated functionality. </p>
    <p class="lh-copy">The chatbot doesn’t overstep its bounds as a bot, and it doesn’t seem like it’s trying too hard to be human. The chatbot seems to lack discoverability, but it’s likely that Uber understands that people aren’t just going to interact with the bot just for fun, maintaining purely utilitarian interactions between bot and user.</p>

    <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Kit CRM</div>

  </section>

  <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
    <p class="lh-copy"><a class="link underline dim silver" href="http://kitcrm.com">Kit</a> is designed to integrate with Shopify stores in order to allow business owners to manage their store’s marketing. Kit acts like a marketing employee in that conversations with it not only enable merchants to take action and start campaigns, but Kit also provides recommendations based on data (store activities and successful campaigns), the same way an actual employee might.</p>

    <p class="lh-copy">I like that Kit takes advantage of a computer’s computational abilities—analyzing data and presenting meaningful results in a way that’s manageable for merchants. I wonder how, as a merchant’s business grows, whether Kit’s capabilities will feel limited in the form of a bot. It seems like a short-term solution for businesses that are just getting started out.</p>

  <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
    <p class="lh-copy">Karim was designed by a research group called <a class="link underline dim silver" href="http://x2.ai">X2AI</a> to provide psychotherapy to Syrian refugees who’ve had traumatic experiences and may not have access to a professional psychotherapist. The concept seems to stretch beyond the idea that chatbots shouldn’t seem too human, but the user studies conducted seemed to indicate that users were able to quickly understand that they weren’t talking to a human, which was actually advantageous in their consultation with Karim. By chatting with a bot, people were unafraid of the potential stigma of mental illness and were more willing to tell the truth.</p>

    <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">design question</h2>

    <p class="lh-copy">After learning more about the principles of good chatbots and digging through some examples, I found that some of the chatbot examples had utility, but only struck me as novel. I really liked the example of Karim, but wanted to see how chatbots could be applied to the treatment of mental illness, but more to the maintenance of mental health—using a salutogenic approach, instead of a pathogenic one. So, that left me wondering:</p>
