        Wayfinding design is essential to the interaction of people and cities, and augmented reality (AR) is newly emerging for consumers as a form of human-computer interaction.
        This module will explore what potential there might be to innovate wayfinding practices with AR.

      <p class="lh-copy"> In <a class="link underline dim silver" href="case-study-1-wayfinding.html">Wayfinding and Augmented Reality</a>, I outlined best practices in both the wayfinding and augmented reality (AR) fields. My findings led me to the design question above.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Since AR on mobile phones is still an emerging technology, I leaned towards designing an add-on to an existing app, instead of a standalone AR app. My hypothesis here is that people are more likely to try AR wayfinding in an app they already trust, than having to go through the work to download a new app.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Aside from the state-of-the art and literature I read up on in my learning module, I wanted to learn specifically, about the kinds of frustrations people might have navigating a campus. So, I asked a few folks, and formed personas around the types of frustrations and questions potential users might have.</p>

        Since one of the wayfinding problems people defined was the lack of, or hidden nature of signage  on campus, I decided to use AR to provide the clear and salient signage that was missing.

      <p class="lh-copy">
        By fitting the AR experience on top of Google Maps existing experience, I was able to take advantage of Google's existing design and interaction patterns from Material Design, as well as provide a trustworthy experience for wayfinding.

      <p class="lh-copy"> In addition to the 4 major types of signage (plus instructional signage), I overlaid navigational information like the path to follow and the estimated time to arrival. Additionally, secondary signage provides context of proximal landmarks so users can familiarize themselves with their surroundings. Secondary signage aims to provide a teaching/learning experience along with a goal-oriented navigational experience.
