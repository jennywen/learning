        Designing with inclusivity in mind is not a new concept. As interfaces become ever more pervasive in the human world, however, inclusion reaches beyond accessibility and usability, and into efforts be more human and considerate.

        Inclusive design (or universal design, design-for-all) was originally conceived in order to accommodate the needs of as many people as possible. This module, however, will explore the definition of inclusive design and highlight some new frontiers in designing for inclusion, as well as best practices.

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Accessibility vs. usability vs. inclusion</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">While the three concepts of accessibility, usability, and inclusion in design are often referred to separately, they resolve for similar results. Additionally, designing optimally for one of the guidelines can often result in better fulfillment of all three.</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Accessibility</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) identifies the internet as a system capable of removing many of the communication and interaction barriers that people with disabilities face in the physical world. Poorly designed and inconsiderate websites and tools, however, also have the potential to exclude users with disabilities.
      </p>
      <!-- <img src="assets/img/wayfinding/landmark.png" class="w-40"/> -->
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Usability</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        In order for designs to be usable, they should help target users achieve their goals “effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use.” Usability is concerned with concepts in ergonomics and cognitive science in order to ensure that the system model of the design is effectively understood by the user in their own mental model.
      </p>
      <!-- <img src="assets/img/wayfinding/progress.png" class="w-40"/> -->
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Inclusion</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        To be inclusive is to design with the intention of meeting the needs of as many users as possible, without designing adaptations to the system. Traditionally, inclusive design has focused on issues like access to the internet, language, age and disability, and social and economic barriers.

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Dimensions of inclusive design</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy"><a class="link fade silver" href="http://idrc.ocadu.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc/49-resources/online-resources/articles-and-papers/443">OCAD University’s Inclusive Design Research Centre</a> details three dimensions that can guide the design of solutions across varying groups of people.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Recognize diversity and uniqueness</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">Most people can’t be described by the “average” use case, and the most inclusive designs allow full customizability for each unique user. Custom solutions are difficult to sustain and implement, so solutions should design for some facet of personalization and integration.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Inclusive process and tools</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">Aside from the solution itself, the preceding design process should aim to include people from all margins as opposed to an elite or exclusive group of designers.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Broader beneficial impact</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">The solution should consider not only the immediate impacts of the system on the specified user, but also the interconnectedness of associated systems and indirect users in order to aim for a net positive effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="center mw6 cf">
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Latest frontiers</h2>

      <p class="lh-copy">These types of inclusion and consideration in interface design are certainly not mutually exclusive (nor are they exhaustive), however, recent concerns about the inclusion of individuals have been voiced.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Cultural</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">As the internet becomes more accessible for a wider array of people across geographical boundaries, cultural and lingual considerations are ever more pressing to designers. While the simplest (but still technically challenging) changes to interfaces involve translation of strings on a website to different languages based on the user’s location , more complex solutions exist in altering the interface completely to meet cultural standards</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">In the design and development of digital products, the two terms <strong>localization</strong> and <strong>internationalization</strong> are often used interchangeably.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">Localization (or l10n) specifies the adaptation of the system to meet the needs of the user dependent on their location/language/cultural context. Some localization considerations include use of colloquial language, date/time formatting, legal requirements, symbols, and perhaps even the overall visual design or workflow of the system.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Internationalization (or i18n), on the other hand, typically refers to the design and development process of a system to enable it to be localized effectively. It is effectively the technical infrastructure for ensuring that designs can be deployed internationally, and that the language and formats of content can be swapped based on locale.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Beyond the implementation of adaptations, designers need to be cognizant of content and mental models that may be interpreted differently across cultural boundaries. When defining target users and use cases, designers should determine the potential impacts of the context in which the system is used, understanding that cultural differences can set dramatically different contexts.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Sexual preference and gender identity</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">Although non-traditional definitions of sexual preference and gender identity are being granted greater equity across the world, the content and workflows of websites and applications often still only consider cisgendered, heteronormative preferences, and nuclear marital/familial circumstances.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">The development of personas is evolving to no longer involve demographic assumptions like age/gender/race can help designers dive deeper into the intents and internal motivations of users instead of focusing on the stereotypical needs of a stock-image caricature. Additionally, by not siloing use cases into a specific demographic, designers can account for a wider array of users and not make conventional assumptions about sexuality and gender, along with other qualifiers like ability and ethnicity</p>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4 lh-copy">
      <p>One of the most common confrontations with a user’s gender or sexuality exists in the settings of an app, or when filling out forms/surveys/questionnaires. Instead of conforming to traditional gender selections (male/female), consider a custom field for those who might not identify with either. Rainbow Health Ontario suggests that bucketing people into an “Other” category is unrepresentative as the variance in gender and sexual preference is higher in those who don’t identify with traditionally assumed identities. Creating a custom field for people to enter their preferred gender pronoun/identity and sexual preference avoids forcing people to preset notions of gender and sexuality, and makes a more inclusive overall experience.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Sensitive interactions</div>
      <p>While difficult to design for every possible use case, technology is ever expanding its breadth of its everyday use. No longer a standalone computer, technology and interfaces permeates interactions like making new friends, booking a place to stay, and even pursuing romantic interests. What may be designed as ordinary interactions for the majority of the population may be traumatic or unproductive for a minority. </p>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4 lh-copy">
      <p>For example, Beth Dean in her article Emotional Intelligence recaps failures of Facebook’s Year in Review feature which offered users an aggregate view of events in their year with a cheerful tone. For some users, however, the feature neglected to filter out events that may have been traumatic or provoked memories of undesirable events. In this case, Facebook made the assumption that all users would find memories of 2015 enjoyable.</p>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4 lh-copy">
      <p>Sara Wachter-Boettcher in her talk, Design for Real Life, speaks about intrusive Mothers’ Day and Fathers’ Day interactions from digital services that made misshapen assumptions about users’ relationships and statuses with their parents. She argues that the popular goal of “designing for delight” can often instead be insensitive and a misguided goal for technology to seem more “human”.</p>

      <p>There seem not to be complete best practices in designing for these sorts of interactions, other than for designers to be more ruthlessly exhaustive in uncovering the potential impacts of their work. As part of the design process, designers should make assumptions, but test assumptions with data and user research. It’s important to keep in mind that by designing for millions of users at a time, technology no longer maintains a neutral stance.</p>
