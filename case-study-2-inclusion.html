        Designing with inclusivity in mind is not a new concept. As interfaces become ever more pervasive in the human world, however, inclusion reaches beyond accessibility and into efforts be more human and considerate.

      <p class="f4 lh-copy">Inclusive design (or universal design, design-for-all) was originally conceived in order to accommodate the needs of as many people as possible. This module, however, will explore the definition of inclusive design and highlight some new frontiers in designing for inclusion, as well as best practices.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Accessibility vs. usability vs. inclusion</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">While the three concepts of accessibility, usability, and inclusion in design are often referred to separately, they resolve for similar results. Additionally, designing optimally for one of the guidelines can often result in better fulfillment of all three.</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Accessibility</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) identifies the internet as a system capable of removing many of the communication and interaction barriers that people with disabilities face in the physical world. Poorly designed and inconsiderate websites and tools, however, also have the potential to exclude users with disabilities.
      </p>
      <!-- <img src="assets/img/wayfinding/landmark.png" class="w-40"/> -->
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Usability</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        In order for designs to be usable, they should help target users achieve their goals “effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use.” Usability is concerned with concepts in ergonomics and cognitive science in order to ensure that the system model of the design is effectively understood by the user in their own mental model.
      </p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Inclusion</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        To be inclusive is to design with the intention of meeting the needs of as many users as possible, without designing adaptations to the system. Traditionally, inclusive design has focused on issues like access to the internet, language, age and disability, and social and economic barriers.

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Latest frontiers of inclusion in interface design</h2>

      <p class="lh-copy">These types of inclusion and consideration in interface design are certainly not mutually exclusive (nor are they exhaustive), however, concerns about the inclusion of individuals has been voiced.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Cultural</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">As the internet becomes more accessible for a wider array of people across geographical boundaries, cultural and lingual considerations are ever more pressing to designers. While the simplest (but still technically challenging) changes to interfaces involve translation of strings on a website to different languages based on the user’s location , more complex solutions exist in altering the interface completely to meet cultural standards</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">In the design and development of digital products, the two terms <strong>localization</strong> and <strong>internationalization</strong> are often used interchangeably.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">Localization (or l10n) specifies the adaptation of the system to meet the needs of the user dependent on their location/language/cultural context. Some localization considerations include use of colloquial language, date/time formatting, legal requirements, symbols, and perhaps even the overall visual design or workflow of the system.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Internationalization (or i18n), on the other hand, typically refers to the design and development process of a system to enable it to be localized effectively. It is effectively the technical infrastructure for ensuring that designs can be deployed internationally, and that the language and formats of content can be swapped based on locale.</p>
