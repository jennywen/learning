        Writing content for interfaces has traditionally been an afterthought, but interactions with writing are an inherent part of using digital interfaces. This module will review best practices for writing interface content.

      <h3 class="f2 lh-copy fw2 i dark-gray">“Great interfaces are written. If you think every pixel, every icon, every typeface matters, then you also need to believe every letter matters”</h3>
    </section>

    <section class="cf mw6 center f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">Often, written content is viewed as an interface element, something to arrange on a page and secondary to the functionality of an interface. Good writing, however, should be considered an essential component to usability. </p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Content vs. copy</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">The terms “content” and “copy” are used interchangeably when describing the words written on a  web page. </p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Copy</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">“Copy” traditionally refers to writing used for marketing and is less essential to the core functionality of the product.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Content</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">“Content”, however, describes words that are functional and are used to help users achieve their goals in the interface. Interface content is also referred to as “microcopy” since the sentences themselves are short. Some places where this sort of content needs to be considered (from <a class="link underline dim silver" href="https://tinywordsmatter.tumblr.com/about">Tiny Words Matter</a>):</p>
      <ul class="list pl0 lh-copy">
        <li>URLs</li>
        <li>Banners and notifications</li>
        <li>Forms (placeholders and labels)</li>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Errors, alerts, security notices</li>
        <li>Page titles</li>
        <li>Headings, subheadings</li>
        <li>Tooltips</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Guidelines</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">While content strategy is a role on its own in the design of a digital product, designers should be aware of content best practices in order to write their own content and to best design with written content in mind. Here are just a few guidelines to help you on your way:</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Say no to Lorem Ipsum</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">Write with real content in mind. Always give your best stab at writing content at every iteration of your design. Lorem Ipsum or filler text often puts text in places where it’s unnecessary and doesn’t consider how the content of your text affects the use of other components on the screen (e.g. navigation, buttons, illustrations, etc.)</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Design with content first</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">
        In determining user flows for your design, consider what kind of content will go where in the design. It’ll help ensure that there aren’t parts of the message that get lost in a user’s workflow, and that consistent language gets used across different screens.
      </p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Be human</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">
        Use language that users understand and already use. Interfaces often get clogged up with technical jargon and insider lingo that doesn’t make sense to ordinary people. For example, instead of “Control Panel”, try “Settings. Instead of “Accepts marketing”, try “Receives email.”
      </p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Consider voice and tone</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">
        Voice is the personality of the product, and it should be consistent and recognizable across an entire product. Tone changes based on use and circumstance. Content should be cheerful when a user accomplishes a milestone, but it probably shouldn’t be cheerful in an error message.
      </p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">All killer, no filler</div>
      <p class="lh-copy">
        Be concise and don’t add writing where it isn’t necessary. Chances are, users won’t read anything that’s not absolutely essential for them to read. If you need to write interface help tips like “Click the button to find out,” then you probably haven’t designed the affordances on the button to be obvious enough. Don’t use writing as a crutch—use it to enhance the experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray ttl">Examples</h2>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Dropbox Paper</div>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">
        <a class="link underline dim silver" href="http://paper.dropbox.com">Dropbox Paper</a> follows best practices for writing copy on buttons by being actionable and creating a clear picture for the user of what to expect once they click the button. Although Dropbox’s team doesn’t have a public-facing content guide, the writing is consistent enough to notice that calls to action are written in sentence case and follow a verb + noun formula.

    </section>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">
        Outside of purely functional text, Paper has built in placeholder text that changes and displays fun quotes once a user starts a new document. The text serves a purpose to provide affordances for typing in Paper’s minimal interface, but it also makes sure that things never stay boring for power users.

    </section>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">In error messages, Shopify maintains the same matter-of-fact voice, and makes sure to not sound too fun or silly when trying to make critical changes to your online store. The error messages also follow a clear hierarchy of text to make sure that the most critical information can be gathered at a glance from the heading alone.</p>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Airbnb</div>

    </section>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">Instead of using the standard “All dates”, Airbnb intentionally uses “Anywhere” and “Anytime” in order to use language that people might more commonly use when they’re talking about getting away to an Airbnb.

    </section>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">I also noticed that the title attribute of their webpage wasn’t just “Airbnb -…” but that it read “Vacation Rentals”, which could be handy for people who are new to Airbnb and might still be calling Airbnbs what they’re used to calling them—vacation rentals.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">I also really liked this tidbit of writing. Instead of just saying “Book soon! 500+ people have viewed this page,” Airbnb says that to me in a way that has meaning to me, and tells me that other people are thinking about renting this place out, and not just viewing the page.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">Many companies have developed style guides and design libraries for design components, but Mailchimp also created and published a public-facing <a class="link underline dim silver" href="http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/">content style guide</a>. The style guide is like a design system but for words, and it spans from high-level goals of writing, all the way down to the nitty-gritty of grammar and mechanics. It helps to make sure everyone’s consistent on matters like number formats and Oxford commas.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">The style guide also includes guidelines for writing for different purposes like on the web, technical guidelines for users, social media, and accessibility to ensure that not only is writing consistent across platforms, but that it also makes sense given the medium its written for.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Aside from the Content Style Guide, Mailchimp also published a <a class="link underline dim silver" href="http://voiceandtone.com/">Voice and Tone guide</a>, specifically dedicated to voice and tone in different instances of writing. The guide’s interface is designed to emulate a conversation between Mailchimp and its user, providing an understanding that writing good content should be framed in the way that the interface is speaking with a user, and not at a user.

    <section class="tl center mw6 cf f4">
      <p class="lh-copy">During my onboarding as an intern at Shopify, each of the new hires on the Product team were given a Voice and Tone guide, regardless of whether they were designers, engineers, product managers, or data scientists. At Shopify, content strategists write content, but so does everyone else who works on the product.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">By using a “this not that” format to guide voice and tone, Shopify identifies the ideal ways to convey itself as a product across the entire platform and in all different circumstances. Using a “not” disqualifier also provides a good antithesis for Shopify’s writing for employees to keep in mind when they’re writing.</p>
