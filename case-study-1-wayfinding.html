      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">principles of wayfinding</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">These guidelines can inform the design of spaces to allow for good wayfinding, and go beyond solutions that are augmented to a space.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Give each location a unique identity</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        Make different locations memorable so people remember whether they’ve been to a place before, and provide a reference point. e.g. painting each of the north/south/east/west entrances a different colour.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/wayfinding/landmark.png" class="w-40"/>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Use landmarks to provide orientation and create memorable locations</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        Landmarks help people describe where they are and provide a relative location. Also, they provide a shared language amongst people who might be communicating about their location.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/wayfinding/progress.png" class="w-40"/>
      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Create well-structured paths</div>
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">
        Paths should be continuous from start to end as not to lose people in the fray. Confirming progress to a destination can help relieve stress and improve trust in the wayfinding system.
      </p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">interface design takeaways</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="center mw6 cf lh-copy">
      <p>In many ways, a wayfinding system is an interface itself. At the very least, wayfinding systems help people navigate the complex interface of the city. Since cities have many more inputs and outputs, and overall, much more variance than say, an iPhone app or a TV screen, wayfinding solutions can provide as an example of an interface with an utmost need for clarity and universality. Some key parallels to make between wayfinding systems and digital interfaces are as follows.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Be consistent and concise</div>
      <p class="mb4">Providing signage amongst the chaos of urban environments forces wayfinding designers to make signage that is simple and reflects the identity of the entire system of signage. Of all the tasks that are possible on the internet, people don’t want to spend their time looking for the actions they already know they want to complete. Also, important messaging like instructions, errors, and warnings should contain the important facts only, and be presented in a way that most users understand. </p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Limit choices in navigation</div>
      <p class="mb4">Providing too many choices in any circumstance can cause decision paralysis for users. Especially for tasks that need to be done that split the user’s attention span, choices should be simple and few. Copy and symbols that indicate navigational options should also be succinct and accurately portray the navigational choice, an analogue for a wayfinding destination.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Provide coherent detours or alternative options</div>
      <p class="mb4">In digital interfaces, users should always be given the option to change their decisions, and their experiences should be coherent regardless of the choices that they make. Additionally, when possible, there should be the option to undo choices. If not, it should be made clear that the choice is irreversible and the consequences of the user’s choice.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Give previews</div>
      <p class="mb4">The same way sightlines and provide insight into the proceeding parts of a wayfinding route, previews of links (through hovering) can help users understand what they are clicking into before they actually do it. Also, in long workflows like onboarding or filling out forms, previews can keep the process transparent and help users understand what the end goal is relative to the list of tasks they’re required to complete.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Have a consistent visual language</div>
      <p class="mb4">By having a design system that defines different types of layouts and a typography system, an interface can have fewer surprises for users. Developing consistent styles for banners and a global navigational structure can help new users understand where to find important messaging and how to get around an interface they might not yet be familiar with.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">augmented reality</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Augmented reality (AR) works by imposing a computer image on a view of reality. Also related is the field of virtual reality (VR), which is a superset of technologies that includes AR. The difference, however, is that AR supplements reality with virtual features, whereas VR supplants reality completely.</p>

    <section class="center mw7 cf">
      <h3 class="f2 lh-title fw2 i dark-gray">With the advent of the modern smartphone, AR applications have new potential to be used by the masses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="center mw6 cf lh-copy">
      <p class="lh-copy mt1">While AR technologies have existed since the origins of computing, they were mostly only used for research, training programs, and some gaming applications. With modern smartphone usage, AR applications have new potential to be used by the masses of average consumers.</p>
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline  serif dark-gray">design principles</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">The following principles adapt existing usability principles for human-computer interaction and apply them to the design of augmented reality systems.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Affordance</div>
      <p class="mb4">AR allows for the complexity of creating affordances in 3D space, and for users to do 3D manipulation in a way that is more intuitive than using a 2D interface.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Reducing cognitive overhead</div>
      <p class="mb4">When designing AR systems, virtual elements should be well-aligned to physical elements as not to increase the amount of cognitive overhead for the user. If the AR interface integrates well with the surrounding environment, users may be able to focus less on the interface itself, and more on the task at hand.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Low physical effort</div>
      <p class="mb4">As with designing most systems, minimizing the number of steps involved in a task prevents users from becoming fatigued. Particularly in AR experiences, users are at risk of disorientation and motion sickness after prolonged use, so additional caution should be taken.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Learnability</div>
      <p class="mb4">AR, as a new technology, may have interactions that are not yet familiar to most users. Therefore, any novel interactions should either reflect behaviours they use in the real world, or mimic computer interactions they’re already used to.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">User satisfaction</div>
      <p class="mb4">Since AR is more immersive and requires higher engagement than traditional screen interfaces, the system should bring some level of satisfaction to users while they’re interacting with it.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Flexibility in use</div>
      <p class="mb4">AR provides opportunities for multi-modal inputs and outputs. Engaging different modalities can make the system easier to use for tasks that are best completed in a certain mode. For example, long texts are easier to speak than they are to type.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Responsiveness and feedback</div>
      <p class="mb4">Unfortunately, the visualization and multimodal nature of AR can require high performance hardware and draw large amounts of computational resources. Therefore, there are trade-offs between complexity/richness and responsiveness of the system.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Error tolerance</div>
      <p class="mb4">Tracking and spatial registration of the real world needs to be highly accurate in order for the interface to be effective. The system, therefore, needs to tolerate for changing environmental conditions and errors made by the user to provide a consistent experience.</p>

      <div class="f3 lh-title dark-gray">Hospital wayfinding</div>
      <p class="mb4">Researchers from the Kyung Hee University, Curtin University, and University of California Berkeley designed an AR system that requires users to orient the system by scanning quick reference (QR) codes on their smartphones. The software then augments salient green arrows to direct users to the closest kitchen in the hospital. The research team encountered difficulties in ensuring that the QR markers could be scanned in all light conditions. The arrows increased size as users walked closer to their destination which proved to be a useful cue.</p>

    <section class="center mw6 cf">
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">design question</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy mb1">Given that augmented reality has the proven ability to customize the ways people interact with the built environment, there seems to be an opportunity to explore its potential in the realm of wayfinding. While the approach that should probably be taken to improving wayfinding should consider its execution only after different types of technology have been considered and eliminated, this exploration does not seek to say that AR should be used absolutely and indefinitely. Instead, it begs to ask where the intersection of these two disciplines might exist, perhaps providing insight into if not AR, then what benefits might a more suitable technology need to provide?</p>
