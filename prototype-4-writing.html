        Writing consistent and coherent content is an essential and oft-overlooked aspect of designing interfaces. This prototype will explore the creation of a content guideline and the implementation of the guidelines in the application interface of a hackathon.

      <p class="lh-copy">I was Hack the North’s UX designer in 2015, and as we approached planning our event and designing the digital tools for our 2016 event, I wanted to think about how we were writing content since it wasn’t something we’d ever thought about. As part of planning the 2016 iteration of the event, I started creating and enforcing content guidelines on our interface and with other organizers who were responsible for writing emails and communicating with sponsors. I was only able to create a first iteration of the guidelines, but this process includes improvements I would have made, given more time.

      <p class="lh-copy">
        The question I had when starting this project was something like this:

      <h3 class="f2 lh-copy fw2 i dark-gray">
        How might we unify Hack the North’s content to be more usable while also reflecting the spirit of the event?

    <section class="center mw6 cf">
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">goals</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">I wanted to unify Hack the North’s content but I also wanted to do it in a way that was usable for the people who were writing content, so my goal was to create a new content guide that would empower every Hack the North organizer to write content that made the event more usable, overall, and that would make them confident in their own writing.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 ttl f-subheadline serif dark-gray">Metrics</h2>
      <ul class="list pl0 lh-copy">
        <li>Decrease help queries from participants and applicants: Ideally, the content we write will make the interfaces we design easy to understand, and they’ll also answer as many of their questions as possible before they email in asking for help.</li>
        <li>Increase the number of applications: Content should encourage people to apply and not inhibit them from using the interface to apply</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">2015 content audit</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Before I went into creating the guidelines, I audited the content from the website, sponsorship package, and applications in order to determine what areas needed improvement, and to try to understand what the content was trying to convey.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">These are buttons, but they don’t have an explicit call to action, and I’m not sure where they’ll lead me once I click them. Also, “Interested in becoming a sponsor?” is a question that’s ultimately a link, but I’m not really sure how that leads me to the answer.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">Hack the North’s voice</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">I ran a brainstorming exercise with the organizing team on a Github issue thread, and these are the characteristics that we determined that really convey Hack the North’s mission. I followed MailChimp’s “this but not that” approach to describing a product’s voice.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">first iteration</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">With Hack the North’s newly minted writing voice, I took a stab at creating a more formal set of guidelines that would outline writing as a whole and be decisive about potential nuances.</p>

    <section class="center mw6 cf">
      <p class="lh-copy">For every “Do”, I also provided a “Don’t” because I wanted to provide examples as well as anti-examples. I established the guidelines and started implementing it in our interfaces.</p>

    <section class="center mw6 cf">
      <p class="lh-copy">As part of our “Hacker Dashboard” (a centralized place for applicants and attendees to access information about the event), I worked on notification banners that would alert applicants of their application status. This is one of the most sensitive interactions that Hack the North has with its applicants, so I applied the content guidelines to ensure that we were using a consistent voice, and adjusting our tone, as well as using writing that was as usable as possible.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">another iteration</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">With the new information I’ve learned about writing content, and to apply the concepts I learned through my case study, I wanted to iterate on the content guide I created last year, and look for places to improve on our content.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">2016 content audit</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Last year, I did the content audit in a really free-form way, so for this iteration, I wanted to be more methodical with a “design with content first” mentality. So, I analyzed the overall workflow of our application process with a focus on the messages and information that each page conveyed.</p>

    <section class="center mw6 cf">
      <p class="lh-copy">From the audit, I identified places where I didn’t like the way that we’d written content before. From there, I established a list of the types of guidelines we were missing from our content guide last year. The types of guidelines spanned all different types like headings and subheading to errors. I decide that it might be best to design an internal tool—a content style guide that could be built on a private URL and passed down and added to from organizing team to organizing team for years to come, similar to MailChimp’s.</p>

      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">content guide 2.0</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Based on the audit, and with new guidelines in mind, I used Hack the North’s branding to create a simple layout for an internal tool that could be built and accessed by all organizers.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">A prototype of the content guide for you to click through is on <a class="link underline dim silver" href="https://invis.io/BSB82R078#/228102097_02">inVision</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="f1 f-subheadline serif dark-gray">next steps</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">I started small, and given the amount of content and types of content we produce on our digital products, this covers most cases. I didn’t, however, consider cases where content is used in other mediums like social media and through emails. Although those cases are outside the scope of a interface writing, they still affect the overall usability of the event and our interfaces since those sources often lead to them. A logical next step would be sitting down with Hack the North’s marketing director and sponsorship director in order to establish guidelines for those parts of the organization in tandem.</p>
